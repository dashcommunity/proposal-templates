# Proposal Template - Simple

###### Description
Provide a brief three- to ten-word tagline that summarizes your project 

###### Example
Donate a masternode to Roger Ver

### Overview

###### Description
Summarize the proposal in narrative form, anywhere from a few sentances to a few paragraphs.  Provide background and context related to the need and motivation for your project.  

Include a brief high-level overview of your scope, schedule, and budget as the final paragraph of this section.

###### Example
Roger Ver is one of the most influencial voices in the cryptocurrency space.  What would happen if we donated a masternode to him to try out?

### Scope

###### Description
This section answers the question *what are you providing*, in narrative form.

###### Example
Let's give Roger Ver a mastenode, and ask for an AMA in return.  This is a bold marketing move.  So bold it just might work.  We need to get a hold of Roger, tell him we want to give him a masternode in exchange for some of his time to help him set it up, try it's features, and hold a public AMA.  The address I have provided on this proposal is owned by Dash Escrow, Inc.  Here is their [cyrptographically signed message](dummylink) proving so.  Dash Escrow has been informed of this proposal and will forward the 1,000 DASH to Roger if it passes. 

##### Deliverables

###### Description
This section provides firm items that you will deliver, in numbered form.

1. Deliverable 1
2. Deliverable 2
3. Deliverable 3

###### Example

1. Cryptographic signed message from Dash Escrow 
  * done (see above)
2. Cryptographic signed message from Roger Ver
  * Will obtain this pending feedback from the community and MNO votes
  * Message will be him agreeing to accept our gift of a an AMA in return for a masternode

### Schedule

###### Description
This section answers the question *when will you complete key milestones*, in narrative form.  

###### Example

Deliverable 2 (Roger's signed message) will be obtained 10 days prior to voting deadline. 

### Budget

###### Description
This section answers the question *how much will it cost*, in narrative form.  

Included here would be a description of what kinds of resources are needed to accomplish your project's deliverables and milestones.  

###### Example

The cost to try this crazy experiment are shown in table 1 below.

##### Itemized Costs

###### Description
This section provides itemized costs, in tabular form

###### Table 1 - Total Costs Requested
|   Item        |    Cost   |   Units  |                       Comment                   |
|---------------|:---------:|:--------:|-------------------------------------------------|
| Masternode    |   1,000   |    DASH  | See Table 3                                     |
| My time       |      25   |    DASH  | Coordination w/ Ver and reporting to community  |
| **Total**     | **1,025** | **DASH** |                                                 |

##### Terms

###### Description
This section answers the question *how much are you requesting over what time period*

Now that you know your total schedule and budget, you can divide the cost accordingly.  If the total time required is 2 months and the total budget requested is 100 DASH, schedule your payment terms as **50 DASH per month** for **2 months**

Terms
* 100 DASH total
  * 50 DASH per month
  * 2 months

###### Example
I am requesting a **single one-time payment of 1,025 DASH**  to accomplish this. 

### Closing

###### Description
This section provides your closing statements

###### Example
This might be a horrible idea, but that's not up to me to decide, but rather, the masternodes.  I hope it gets funded.  I will make sure Roger is taken care of if it does.
