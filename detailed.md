# Proposal Template - Detailed

###### Description
Provide a brief three- to ten-word tagline that summarizes your project 

###### Example
Salary for dash core team

### Overview

###### Description
Summarize the proposal in narrative form, anywhere from a few sentances to a few paragraphs.  Provide background and context related to the need and motivation for your project.  

Include a brief high-level overview of your scope, schedule, and budget as the final paragraph of this section.

###### Example
While v12 enabled budgeting and removed the reference node, our donation system was rendered inoperable by the latest version. The donation feature was supporting many of our developers, so we would like to replace that income stream with a more permanent solution that does not rely on altruism.

Working on Dash should come with some incentive, like receiving some money from the blockchain every month. However, we don't want to micromanage an open source project and we feel we have a highly trustworthy team. The way we plan on using the core team budget is to simply split it between all team members.

### Scope

###### Description
This section answers the question *what are you providing*, in narrative form.

###### Example

*Template author's note: the core-team proposal on dashcentral.org does not exactly present the scope as intended by this template (i.e. answering the question: "what are you providing").  I have pasted in the closest approximation I could find within the body of that proposal.  I have also rearranged it slightly and broken it up into sections for greater readability.*

**Human Resource Management**

To be a paid team member, one simply needs to agree to our pledge. The pledge is To work on Dash each and every day to expand and improve the ecosystem to the best of my ability?. Whatever someone feels they can contribute to the project is fine, as long as they meet that minimum amount of work. 

Our team structure is highly organized. We have professional project managers onboard which are helping monitor and optimize our process. These project managers have pledged to act as objective observers, hold each team member accountable for what they say they will do, and will recommend if some team members are underperforming or for other reasons need to be removed from a paid spot on the team.

**Scope of services**

Anyone, with any skill set (software, quality assurance, automation, admin, marketing, legal, etc) is needed. 

##### Deliverables

###### Description
This section provides firm items that you will deliver, in numbered form.

1. Deliverable 1
2. Deliverable 2
3. Deliverable 3

###### Example
*Template author's note: the core-team proposal on dashcentral.org does not present the scope as intended by this template (i.e. answering the question: "what are you providing").  I have re-created a sample list, based on the explicit work that has been performed, and the implicit expectations of the community. Below is an incomplete list.  Someone from core or the commmunity is more than welcome to help fill this out*

1. Regular software updates
 1. 0.12.1
 2. 0.12.2
 3. Evolution
2. Communication intentions and project expectations via a regularly updated project roadmap
3. Human resource management
4. [Official documentation](https://dashpay.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DOC/Official+Documentation)
5. Forum management
6. Foundation management

### Schedule

###### Description
This section answers the question *when will you complete key milestones*, in narrative form.  

Milestones should be described here such that you can refer to them (e.g. by name) in the section below.  Decribe the relationship between milestones: what depends on what and whom.  You should be able to provide **specific dates** for deliverables under your (or your firm's) exclusive control.  Some tasks require input (e.g. separate deliverables) from third parties.  Although a properly planned and managed project will generally be able to deliver specific dates *even with* third parties, it is sometimes more appropriate to communicate **relative dates** in such cases, always updating and communicating updates with best available data.

###### Example
*Template author's note: the core-team proposal on dashcentral.org does not present the schedule as intended by this template (i.e. answering the question: "when will you complete key milestones").  I have pasted in the closest approximation I could find within the body of that proposal.  Someone from core or the commmunity is more than welcome to help fill this out*

It's up to the person how much they work on Dash and how much they are able to earn from the project.  Some of us will work really hard on Dash (often for 10+ hours a day), because we believe in it and we're willing to put in the time to make Dash a critical part of the future economy. We believe it's worth the time to do this.  Others have full time jobs, but they like to contribute during mornings, nights, and weekends. This is all great, the more people we can get putting effort into the project the better off we'll be in the long run.

##### Milestones

###### Description
This section provides a reasonable project schedule.  Estimate dates based on best available data.  Anticipate potential issues and provide assumptions/comments to  and manage personal and third-party expectations.  Milestones may or may not correspond one-to-one with deliverables.  

###### Example
*Template author's note: the core-team proposal on dashcentral.org does not present the schedule as intended by this template (i.e. answering the question: "when will you complete key milestones").  I have created a small sample list intended to be edited at some time with better information.  Someone from core or the commmunity is more than welcome to help fill this out*

###### Table 1 - Project Milestones
| Milestone   |              Description      | Completion Date |               Comment               |
|-------------|-------------------------------|:---------------:|-------------------------------------|
| MS 1        | Deliverable 1.1, 1.2 planned  |    2016-11-01   | Mostly done already                 |
| MS 2        | Deliverable 1.1 done          |    2016-12-01   | Confident delivery date             |

### Budget

###### Description
This section answers the question *how much will it cost*, in narrative form.  

Included here would be a description of what kinds of resources are needed to accomplish your project's deliverables and milestones.  

###### Example

*Template author's note: the core-team proposal on dashcentral.org does not present the schedule as intended by this template (i.e. answering the question: "when will you complete key milestones").  I have pasted in the closest approximation I could find within the body of that proposal.  Someone from core or the commmunity is more than welcome to help fill this out*

**Fund Allocation Transparency**

We will be 100% transparent about who on our team is paid and how much they are paid. As defined, a core team member is someone that has made the above pledge to work on Dash everyday. That person then has the freedom to work on Dash as much as they wish to expand their earning potential. We believe in transparency when it comes to the administration of a decentralized product such as Dash, so we will make this data available on one of the websites for the community.

**Compensation Methodology**

I'd like to stress that this compensation is by no means meant to provide a "full-time salary" for contributors. Compensation will be modest. At current market prices, the compensation would fall in the category of token appreciation.  We intend to have 2 kinds of slots for paid team members depending on the amount of time they are willing to commit - part-time and full-time. Full-time slots will offer payment of 2-4x (TBD by the project management team, maybe even a monthly contest?) that of a part-time slot. Team members can switch between the two depending on how much they feel they can offer to the project. This should give us flexibility to provide incentive for development and show appreciation for the work that is being done.  We will also encourage team members to hold their Dash they are paid long term.
